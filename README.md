# CodecTune

This repository contains the artifacts of the CodecTune project. The individual components are in the subdirectories:

- `codec-driver`: A wrapper that drives the x265 encoder to encode videos
- `fixed-workload`: Three configuration tuning algorithms for tuning the codec against a specific video
- `CDBTune`: The content-aware codec configuration tuner

Refer to the READMEs in each subdirectory for the usage of each component. Refer to REPRODUCE.md for reproducing the results in the report.
